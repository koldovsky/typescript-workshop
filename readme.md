# TypeScript 2 WorkShop by [programming mentor](http://programmingmentor.com)

Welcome to the practice-first WorkShop on [**TypeScript** programming language](http://typescriptlang.com).

For the convenience WorkShop has been split on several steps that should be completed one after another.
Instructions for each steps are placed in `readme.md` files in the corresponding folders.
Also each folder has files that are produced as result of completing instruction for the step.

If you want to skip some steps, use files from previous step.      

This WorkShop is created by [*Vyacheslav Koldovskyy* aka **programming mentor**](http://programmingmentor.com).
